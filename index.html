  <h1>What Does Responsive Web Design (RWD) Solve?</h1>
  <p>When designing web pages, one of the biggest problems that web page developers encounter is creating a page that renders well regardless of the size of the viewing screen. Back in the late 1990's and early 2000's it was not uncommon to see web pages that had hyperlinks where users could choose a mobile view or a desktop view.</p>
  
  <p>However, developers that chose this route then created the need to maintain two different web pages. This increased the amount of code that needed to be created in order to maintain the content and structure.</p>
  
  <p>Responsive Web Design makes your web pages render well on all kinds of devices - desktops, laptops, tablets and cell phones.</p>
